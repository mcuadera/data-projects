    "1. What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "2. What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "The project focused on writing four main functions:\n",
    "- `one_ticket_probability()` — calculates the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket\n",
    "- `check_historical_occurrence()` — checks whether a certain combination has occurred in the Canada lottery data set\n",
    "- `multi_ticket_probability()` — calculates the probability for any number of of tickets between 1 and 13,983,816\n",
    "- `probability_less_6()` — calculates the probability of having two, three, four or five winning numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible features for a second version of the app include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Making the outputs even easier to understand by adding fun analogies (for example, we can find probabilities for strange events and compare with the chances of winning in lottery; for instance, we can output something along the lines \"You are 100 times more likely to be the victim of a shark attack than winning the lottery\").\n",
    "- Combining the one_ticket_probability() and check_historical_occurrence() to output information on probability and historical occurrence at the same time.\n",
    "- Creating a function similar to probability_less_6() which calculates the probability of having at least two, three, four or five winning numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the app should be able to calculate probabilities from additional lottery systems."
